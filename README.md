## Description

This webpage is where I take a little bit of time to describe myself, showcase some of my best programming projects, and provide contact information as well as my professional resume. The page is for practical purposes and doesn't have much dynamic functionality. It does, however, include a little bit of JavaScript, dynamic styling, and it is presented in a pleasing, professional manner. I have had a lot of fun building this page, and I am really enjoying adding more projects to it as I build my skills as a programmer!
As one of my first programming projects, this web page is hard-coded, plain HTML and CSS, and sprinkled on top with a little JavaScript. I enjoy the nostalgia of keeping this page in such a state. Coming back to update it periodically has been a nice exercise in maintaining my skills with the old HTML/CSS duo.
