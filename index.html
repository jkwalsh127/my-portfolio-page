      <hr>
      <p class='text-barlow'>As a programming hobbyist, I have spent several years building scripts for algorithmic stock trading, as well as chart indicators to assist in interpreting market fluctuations. Knowing that I wanted to work in tech, I began taking online courses for more applicable skills like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I eventually decided to take my skills to the next level by enrolling at the UC Berkeley Extension to earn my full-stack web development certificate. I am currently aspiring and working towards getting hired at a company, small or large, to help build their platform.</p>
      <p class='text-barlow'>Outside of programming, I received a B.S. in biochemistry from UC Davis and have spent 4+ years as an aircraft structural mechanic for the California National Guard. I am confident that my wide array of technical skills equip me to easily adapt and quickly become a productive asset and trusted colleague.</p>
      <p class='text-barlow'> On my free-time, I enjoy activities like camping, backpacking, fishing, vegetable gardening, woodworking, and of course, spending time with family and friends.</p>

              This is an indicator meant to assist investors in deciphering an asset’s current trend and the momentum behind it.
              It was my first custom indicator built using TradingView’s coding platform and proprietary language, PineScript. A technical understanding of several traditional indicators was required, and PineScript’s UI development capabilities allowed me to mold them into a single, user-friendly display.

            This project was my first full-stack application from scratch. I worked with two classmates to develop a tool designed for programmers, but one that can also be effective for anyone who works from a computer. It is equipped with features like the ability to record the amount of time spent and value earned on each project a user works on, a progarmmable timer that alerts users to take an exercise break, and also the ability to save notes or code-snippets for later user. The built in database stores all this info for a user to maintain as their project list grows.

            This project is a full-stack website meant to provide home gardeners with planting schedules, growing guides, and a place to store details and notes on their past gardens. 
            <br>
            My initial roles were to connect the API route to fetch growing schedules based on  a user’s zip code, as well as implement our database and the necessary routes to read and create the notes that would be stored there. I also designed the page layouts and css styling, and developed many of the React components that were used in this project.

            This was a full-stack project intended to get familiar with a new stack. It was the first time that I used MaterialUI as well as the first time I used any of the AWS tools (I primarily used Amplify for this project). The intended use is for team meetings, where agends can be displayed, and the list of topics could be walked through and discussed. While the functionality is simple, the final product is clean and intuitive. This app comes complete with CRUD operations to a GraphQL database.

          For this demo, I built a react app to demonstrate how a simple keylogger can retrieve data. I add one small JavaScript file and install a single dependency package. The "EmailJS" package is included to use their SMTP server to send emails containing the logged data. A messageis sent everytime a user types something within the app and then clicks their mouse or hits enter. In practice, the messages would contain every string of characters a user entered before submitting a form or field. While this is a simple design, it shows how a commonly used package can be utilized to enact a very serious invasion of people's property.

            IDBdatabase is used to store data on the browser, webpack is used to minify assets to lower load time, the manifest plugin is used to provide instructions necessary to install the app locally, workbox is used to build out the service worker that can fulfill requests without network connectivity, and the babel CLI is used in the build process to compile ES6 code to older versions.
